To Create a new local repository                                                                            git init

Tell Git who you are 	                                                                               git config --global user.name "Sam Smith"
Configure the author name and email address to be used with your
 commits.Note that Git strips some characters (for example trailing periods) 
from user.name.
	
Add files 	                                                                                                               git add *

Status 	List the files you've changed and those you still need to add                  git status
                or commit: 	


git config --global user.email sam@example.com

                                                          local repository to a remote server, 
                                                        add the server to be able to push to it:            git remote add origin <server>
